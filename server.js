// 1. Your app should have a route of '/greeting' and it should send a generic greeting to the screen 
//like "Hello, stranger".
// 2. Your app should have a route of '/greeting/:name' and it should expect 1 param which takes 
//in a person's name. When hitting the route, the page should display a message such as 
//"Hello, ", or "What's up, <name>", or "<name>! It's so great to see you!" 
//(ex. hitting '/greeting/Jimmy-boy' should display Wow! Hello there, Jimmy-boy on the page).

// Tip Calculator
// Your app should have a route of '/tip' and it should expect 2 params. One should be total and one should be tipPercentage.

// Magic 8 Ball
// Create a route of '/magic' that should expect a phrase in the URL that ask the Magic 8 ball a question.

// So if the user hits that route and asks a question of "Will I be a Millionaire" 
//(ex. '/magic/Will%20I%20Be%20A%20Millionaire') 
//they should see returned to them their question AND a random Magic 8 ball response (see the array below) on the screen.

// Remember that we can't use spaces in the url, so we use %20 to express a space in the url.

// Use this array of Magic 8 ball responses.....
